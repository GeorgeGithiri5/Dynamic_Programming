## Dynamic Programming

Dynamic Programming is mainly and optimization over plain recursion. Wherever we see recursive solution that has repeated calls for same input,we can optimize it using Dynamic Programming. The idea is to simply store the results of subproblems,so that we do not have recompute them when needed later.

This simple optimization reduces time complexities from exponential to polynomial.
